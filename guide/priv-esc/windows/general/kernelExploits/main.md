## Kernel Exploits

### Basic Commands/steps

**Note**
Kernel exploits should be our last resource, since it might but the machine in an unstable state or create some other problem with the machine.

Identify the hotfixes/patches

```
systeminfo
# or
wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn

```
**Python to Binary**
If we have an exploit written in python but we don't have python installed on the victim-machine we can always transform it into a binary with pyinstaller. Good trick to know.
