## smb checklist

### Steps

#### 1. Check users / Enumerate users

- Check if user `guest` with password `''` can login and what shares he has got.
    - No shares that are interesting?
    - Enumerate users with msfconsole (see `/recon/windows/msfconsole`) and try username as password.

#### Post-exploitation

- Got an SMB account but no interesting shares anymore
    - use `impacket` (see `/recon/windows/impacket`) to list kerberoastable accounts to get administrator privileges.
    - crack the hashes you got out of the tickets and see if you got an useable password to access the account again via SMB as that user and look around more.
